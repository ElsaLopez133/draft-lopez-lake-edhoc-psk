1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   Pre-shared key (PSK) authentication method provides a balance between
   security and computational efficiency.  This authentication method
   was proposed in the first drafts of Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over
   COSE (EDHOC), and was ruled out to speed out the development process.
   However, there is now a renewed effort to reintroduce PSK
   authentication, making this draft an update to the [RFC9528].

   One prominent use case of PSK authentication in the EDHOC protocol is
   the update of session keys.  This method aims to reduce the
   computational cost that comes with re-running the protocol with
   public authentication keys.  This efficiency is beneficial in
   scenarios where frequent key updates are needed, such in resource-
   constrained environments or applications requiring high-frequency
   secure communications.  The use of PSK authentication in EDHOC
   ensures that session key can be refreshed without heavy computational
   overhead, typically associated with public key operations, thus
   optimizing both performance and security.

   The resumption capability in Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
   leveraging EDHOC can benefit from this method.  EAP-EDHOC resumption
   aims to provide a streamlined process for re-establishing secure
   sessions, reducing latency and resource consumption.  By employing
   PSK authentication for key updates, EAP-EDHOC resumption can achieve
   secure session resumption, enhancing overall efficiency and user
   experience.

   EDHOC with PSK authentication is also beneficial for existing systems
   where two nodes have been provided with a PSK from other parties.
   This allows the nodes to perform ephemeral Diffie-Hellman to achieve
   Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), ensuring that past communications
   remain secure even if the PSK is compromised.  The authentication
   provided by EDHOC prevents eavesdropping by on-path attackers, as
   they would need to be active participants in the communication to
   intercept and potentially tamper with the session.  Examples could be
   Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) and Authenticated Key
   Management Architecture (AKMA) in mobile systems, or Peer and
   Authenticator in EAP.

1.2.  Assumptions

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol

   There are currently two proposed versions of the authentication
   method, depending on where the pre-shared key identifier
   (ID_CRED_PSK) is sent.  ID_CRED_PSK allows retrieval of CRED_PSK, a
   COSE object that contains the PSK.

   In both cases, Initiator and Responder are assumed to have a PSK with
   good amount of randomness and the requirements that:

   *  Only the Initiator and the Responder have access to the PSK.

   *  The Responder is able to retrieve the PSK using ID_CRED_PSK.

   where:

   *  ID_CRED_PSK is a COSE header map containing header parameters that
      can identify a pre-shared key.  For example:

   ID_CRED_PSK = {4 : h'lf' }

   *  CRED_PSK is a COSE_Key compatible credential, encoded as a CCS or
      CWT.  For example:

   {                                               /CCS/
     2 : "mydotbot",                               /sub/
     8 : {                                         /cnf/
       1 : {                                       /COSE_Key/
          1 : 4,                                   /kty/
          2 : h'32',                               /kid/
         -1 : h'50930FF462A77A3540CF546325DEA214'  /k/
       }
     }
   }

   The purpose of ID_CRED_PSK is to facilitate the retrieval of the PSK.
   It is RECOMMENDED that it uniquely identifies the CRED_PSK as the
   recipient might otherwise have to try several keys.  If ID_CRED_PSK
   contains a single 'kid' parameter, then the compact encoding is
   applied; see Section 3.5.3.2 of [RFC9528].  The authentication
   credential CRED_PSK substitutes CRED_I and CRED_R specified in
   [RFC9529], and, when applicable, MUST follow the same guidelines
   described in Sections 3.5.2 and 3.5.3 of [RFC9528].

4.  Variant 1

   In the first variant of the method the ID_CRED_PSK is sent in the
   clear in the first message.  Figure 1 shows the message flow of
   Variant 1.

   Initiator                                                   Responder

   |                           AEAD( EAD_4 )                           |

              Figure 1: Overview of message flow of Variant 1.

   This variant incurs minimal modifications with respect to the current
   methods described in [RFC9528] and the fourth message remains
   optional.  MAC_3 is removed in message_3 and replaced by AEAD.  This
   approach is similar to TLS 1.3, and, consequently, has similar
   privacy issues.  For example:

   *  *Identity Leakage*: neither the identity of the Initiator nor the
      Responder are protected against active or passive attackers.  By
      sending the ID_CRED_PSK in the clear, the initiator reveals its
      identity to any eavesdropper on the network.  This allows passive
      observers to learn which client is attempting to connect to the
      server.

   *  *Tracking and correlation*: An attacker can use the plaintext
      ID_CRED_PSK to track the client across multiple connections, even
      if those connections are made from different networks or at
      different times.  This enables long-term tracking of clients.

   *  *Information leakage about relationships*: ID_CRED_PSK also
      reveals information about the relationship between the client and
      the server.  An observer can infer that the two parties have a
      pre-existing relationship and have previously agreed on a shared
      secret.

   *  *Replay and preplay attacks*: ID_CRED_PSK can facilitate replay
      attacks.  An attacker might use the observed ID_CRED_PSK to
      initiate their own connection attempts, potentially leading to
      denial-of-service or other attacks.

   *  *Downgrade attacks*: If multiple PSKs are available (e.g., of
      varying strengths or for different purposes), an attacker might
      attempt to force the use of a weaker or less privacy-preserving
      PSK by manipulating the ID_CRED_PSK field.

4.1.  Variant 2

   The ID_CRED_PSK is sent in message_3, encrypted using a key derived
   from the ephemeral shared secret, G_XY.  In this case, the Responder
   will authenticate the Initiator first, contrary to Variant 1.
   Figure 2 shows the message flow of Variant 2.

   Initiator                                                   Responder

   |                      G_Y, Enc( C_R, EAD_2 )                       |
   |<------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                             message_2                             |
   |                                                                   |
   |                   Enc( ID_CRED_PSK ), AEAD( EAD_3 )               |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------>|
   |                             message_3                             |
   |                                                                   |
   |                           AEAD( EAD_4 )                           |
   |<------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                             message_4                             |

              Figure 2: Overview of message flow of Variant 2.

   Contrary to Variant 1, this approach provides protection against
   passive attackers for both Initiator and Responder. message_4 remains
   optional, but is needed to achieve mutual authentication if not
   relaying on external applications, such as OSCORE.

5.  Key derivation

   The pseudorandom keys (PRKs) used for PSK authentication method in
   EDHOC are derived using EDHOC_Extract, as done in [RFC9528].

   PRK  = EDHOC_Extract( salt, IKM )

   where the salt and input keying material (IKM) are defined for each
   key.  The definition of EDHOC_Extract depends on the EDHOC hash
   algorithm selected in the cipher suite.

5.1.  Variant 1

   Figure 3 lists the key derivations that differ from those specified
   in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC9528].

PRK_3e2m      = EDHOC_Extract( salt3e_2m, CRED_PSK )
PRK_4e3m      = PRK_3e2m
MAC_2         = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_3e2m,      2,  context_2,  mac_length_2 )
K_3           = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_4e3m,    TBD,  context_3,  key_length   )
IV_3          = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_4e3m,    TBD,  context_3,  iv_length    )

   where:

   *  context_2 = <<C_R, ID_CRED_PSK, TH_2, CRED_PSK, ? EAD_2>>

   *  context_3 = <<ID_CRED_PSK, TH_3, CRED_PSK, ? EAD_3>>

5.2.  Variant 2

   Figure 4 lists the key derivations that differ from those specified
   in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC9528].

  PRK_4e3m      = EDHOC_Extract( SALT_4e3m, CRED_PSK )
  KEYSTREAM_3   = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_3e2m,    TBD,  TH_3,       key_length )
  K_3           = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_4e3m,    TBD,  context_3,  key_length )
  IV_3          = EDHOC_KDF( PRK_4e3m,    TBD,  context_3,  iv_length  )

    Figure 4: Key derivation of variant 2 of EDHOC PSK authentication
                                 method.

   where:

   *  KEYSTREAM_3 is used to encrypt the ID_CRED_PSK in message_3.

   *  context_3 <<ID_CRED_PSK, TH_3, CRED_PSK, ? EAD_3>>

   *  TH_3 = H( TH_2, PLAINTEXT_2)

   *  TH_4 = H( TH_3, ID_CRED_PSK, ? EAD_3, CRED_PSK )

6.  Message formatting and processing.  Differences with respect to
    [RFC9528]

   This section specifies the differences on the message formatting
   compared to [RFC9528].

6.1.  Variant 1

6.1.1.  Message 1

   message_1 contains the ID_CRED_PSK.  The composition of message_1
   SHALL be a CBOR sequence, as defined below:

   message_1 = (
     METHOD : int,
     SUITES_I : suites,
     G_X : bstr,
     C_I : bstr / -24..23,
     ID_CRED_PSK : header map // kid_value : bstr,
     ? EAD_1,
   )

   suites =  [ 2* int ] / int
   EAD_1 = 1* ead

   where:

   *  ID_CRED_PSK is an identifier used to facilitate retrieval of the
      PSK.

   The Initiator includes ID_CRED_PSK in message_1 and encodes the full
   message as a sequence of CBOR-encoded data items as specified in
   Section 5.2.1. of [RFC9528]

   The Responder SHALL process message_1 as follows:

   *  Decode message_1.

   *  Retrieve CRED_PSK using ID_CRED_PSK.

   *  Process message_1 as specified in Section 5.2.3. of [RFC9528].

6.1.2.  Message 2

   message_2 SHALL be a CBOR sequence, defined as:

   message_2 = (
     G_Y_CIPHERTEXT_2 : bstr,
   )

   where:

   *  G_Y_CIPHERTEXT_2 is the concatenation of G_Y (i.e., the ephemeral
      public key of the Responder) and CIPHERTEXT_2.

   *  CIPHERTEXT_2 is calculated with a binary additive stream cipher,
      using KEYSTREAM_2 and the following plaintext:

      -  PLAINTEXT_2 = (C_R, / bstr / -24..23, MAC_2, ? EAD_2)

      -  CIPHERTEXT_2 = PLAINTEXT_2 XOR KEYSTREAM_2

   The Responder uses MAC instead of Signature.  Hence, COSE_Sign1 is
   not used.  The Responder computes MAC_2 as described in Section 4.1.2
   of [RFC9528], with context_2 <<C_R, ID_CRED_PSK, TH_2, CRED_PSK, ?
   EAD_2>>

6.1.3.  Message 3

   message_3 SHALL be a CBOR sequence, defined as:

   message_3 = (
     CIPHERTEXT_3 : bstr,
   )

   The Initiator computes a COSE_Encrypt0 object as defined in
   Section 5.2 and 5.3 of [RFC9052] with the EDHOC AEAD algorithm of the
   selected cipher suite and the following parameters:

   *  K_3 and IV_3 as defined in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC9528]

   *  PLAINTEXT_3 = ( ID_CRED_PSK / bstr / -24..2, ? EAD_3 )

   The Initiator computes TH_4 = H( TH_3, ID_CRED_PSK, PLAINTEXT_3,
   CRED_PSK )

6.1.4.  Message 4

   message_4 SHALL be a CBOR sequence, defined as:

   message_4 = (
     CIPHERTEXT_4 : bstr,
   )

   message_4 is optional.

6.2.  Variant 2

6.2.1.  Message 1

   Same as message_1 of EDHOC, described in Section 5.2.1 of [RFC9528].

6.2.2.  Message 2

   message_2 SHALL be a CBOR sequence, defined as:

   message_2 = (
     G_Y_CIPHERTEXT_2 : bstr,
   )

   where:

   *  G_Y_CIPHERTEXT_2 is the concatenation of G_Y (i.e., the ephemeral
      public key of the Responder) and CIPHERTEXT_2.

   *  CIPHERTEXT_2 is calculated with a binary additive stream cipher,
      using KEYSTREAM_2 and the following plaintext:

      -  PLAINTEXT_2 = ( C_R, / bstr / -24..23, ? EAD_2 )

      -  CIPHERTEXT_2 = PLAINTEXT_2 XOR KEYSTREAM_2

   Contrary to [RFC9528] and Variant 1, MAC_2 is not needed.

6.2.3.  Message 3

   message_3 SHALL be a CBOR Sequence, as defined below:

   message_3 = (
     CIPHERTEXT_3
   )

   where:

   *  CIPHERTEXT_3 is a concatenation of two different ciphertexts:

      -  CIPHERTEXT_3A is calculated with a binary additive stream
         cipher, using a KESYSTREAM_3 generated with EDHOC_Expand and
         the following plaintext:

         o  PLAINTEXT_3A = ( ID_CRED_PSK )

      -  CIPHERTEXT_3B is a COSE_Encrypt0 object as defined in Sections
         5.2 and 5.3 of [RFC9052], with the EDHOC AEAD algorithm of the
         selected cipher suite, using the encryption key K_3, the
         initialization vector IV_3 (if used by the AEAD algorithm), the
         parameters described in Section 5.2 of [RFC9528], plaintext
         PLAINTEXT_3B and the following parameters as input:

         o  protected = h''

         o  external_aad = context_3, defined in Section 5.2

         o  K_3 and IV_3 as defined in Section 5.2

         o  PLAINTEXT_3B = ( ? EAD_3 )

   The Initiator computes TH_4 = H( TH_3, ID_CRED_PSK, PLAINTEXT_3,
   CRED_PSK ), defined in Section 5.2.

6.2.4.  Message 4

   message_4 SHALL be a CBOR sequence, defined as:

   message_4 = (
     CIPHERTEXT_4 : bstr,
   )

   A fourth message is mandatory.  The Initiator MUST NOT persistently
   store PRK_out or application keys until the Initiator has verified
   message_4 or a message protected with a derived application key, such
   as an OSCORE message, from the Responder and the application has
   authenticated the Responder.

7.  Security Considerations

   When evaluating the security considerations, it is important to
   differentiate between the initial handshake and session resumption
   phases.

   1.  *Initial Handshake*: a fresh CRED_PSK is used to establish a
       secure connection.

   2.  *Session Resumption*: the same PSK identifier (ID_CRED_PSK) is
       reused each time EDHOC is executed.  While this enhances
       efficiency and reduces the overhead of key exchanges, it presents
       privacy risks if not managed properly.  Over multiple resumption
       sessions, initiating a full EDHOC session changes the resumption
       PSK, resulting in a new ID_CRED_PSK.  The periodic renewal of the
       CRED_PSK and ID_CRED_PSK helps mitigate long-term privacy risks
       associated with static key identifiers.

7.1.  Identity protection

   The current EDHOC methods protect the Initiator’s identity against
   active attackers and the Responder’s identity against passive
   attackers.  However, there are differences between the two variants
   described in this draft:

   1.  *Variant 1*: neither the Initiator's identity nor the Responder's
       identity are protected against active or passive attackers.

   2.  *Variant 2*: both the Initiator's and Responder's identities are
       protected against passive attackers.

7.2.  Number of messages

   The current EDHOC protocol consists of three mandatory messages and
   an optional fourth message.  The PSK authentication method might
   require a compulsory message depending on which variant is employed:

   1.  *Variant 1*: message_4 is optional since both identities are
       authenticated after message_3.

   2.  *Variant 2*: message_4 remains optional, but mutual
       authentication is not guaranteed without it, or an OSCORE
       message.

7.3.  External Authorization Data

   In both variants, the Initiator and Responder can send information in
   EAD_3 and EAD_4 or in OSCORE messages in parallel with message_3 and
   message_4.  This is possible because the Initiator knows that only
   the entity with access to the CRED_PSK can decrypt the information.

7.4.  Optimization

   1.  *Variant 1*: ID_CRED_PSK is sent without encryption, saving
       computational resources at the cost of privacy.  The exposure of
       ID_CRED_PSK in message_1 allows for earlier key derivation on the
       responder's side, potentially speeding up the process.

   2.  *Variant 2*: It requires encryption of ID_CRED_PSK in message_3,
       which implies higher computational cost.

7.5.  Mutual Authentication

   Mutual authentication is achieved at earlier stages in Variant 1,
   which might be important in certain applications, as well as
   increasing security against Denial of Service attacks or oracle
   attacks.

7.6.  Attacks

   1.  *Variant 1*: it allows for earlier authentication, potentially
       improving resistance to some active attacks, but at the cost of
       reduced privacy and increased vulnerability to passive attacks
       and traffic analysis.-

   2.  *Variant 2*: it offers better privacy and resistance to passive
       attacks but might be more vulnerable to certain active attacks
       due to delayed authentication.

8.  Privacy Considerations

9.  Unified Approach and Recommendations

   To improve privacy during both initial handshake and session
   resumption, a single unified method for handling PSKs could be
   beneficial.  Variant 2 is particularly suitable for this purpose as
   it streamlines key management and usage across different phases.

   For use cases involving the transmission of application data,
   application data can be sent concurrently with message_3, maintaining
   the protocol's efficiency.  In scenarios such as EAP-EDHOC, where
   application data is not sent, message_4 is mandatory.  Other
   implementations may continue using OSCORE in place of EDHOC
   message_4, with a required change in the protocol's language to: The
   Initiator SHALL NOT persistently store PRK_out or application keys
   until the Initiator has verified message_4 or a message protected
   with a derived application key, such as an OSCORE message.

   This change ensures that key materials are only stored once their
   integrity and authenticity are confirmed, thereby enhancing privacy
   by preventing early storage of potentially compromised keys.

   Lastly, whether the Initiator or Responder authenticates first is not
   relevant when using symmetric keys.  This consideration was important
   for the privacy properties when using asymmetric authentication but
   is not significant in the context of symmetric key usage.
